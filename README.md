# `config-sync`
A simple utility for synchronizing various config files across Linux and MacOS to streamline the setup of new systems.

## Motivation
My development environment is composed of a number of terminal-based tools that work across both Linux and MacOS. My personal projects are developed either on a MacBook Pro or an Ubuntu desktop depending on which environment makes the most sense for the project that I'm currently working on. I will frequently make tweaks to my development environment as my needs and preferences change; maintaining consistency across machines requires manually copying any changes from one machine to another which is extraordinarily tedious. I'd also like to automate the setup of a new dev box, which requires having an up-to-date snapshot of my preferred settings. This tool is an attempt to make this problem more tractable.
